    <h2>When should you get test for covid 19??</h2>
    <p>Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but <b>have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected</b> may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.  <br><br>

      While a person is waiting for test results, they should <b>remain isolated</b> from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities.</p>

    <h2> Tests</h2>
    
    <h3>PCR molecular test</h3>
    <p>In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. <b>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test.</b> <br><br>Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by <b>amplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels.</b> For this reason, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin.</p>
    <h3>Rapid Tests</h3>
    <p><b>Rapid antigen tests</b> (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test – RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are <b>collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab.</b><br><br> These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious. </p>

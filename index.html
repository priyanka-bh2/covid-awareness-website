    <h2> Origin of Corona Virus </h2>
    
    <p>The coronavirus outbreak came to light on December 31, 2019 when China informed the World Health Organisation of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan City in Hubei Province.<br><br> Subsequently the disease spread to more Provinces in China, and to the rest of the world. The WHO has  declared it a pandemic. The virus has been named <b>SARS-CoV-2</b> and the disease is now called <b>COVID-19</b></p>

  <h2>What is COVID 19?</h2>
    
  <p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes <b>an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. </b><br><br>
    COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your <b>upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).</b></p>
    <hr>

  <h2>How does it spread???</h2>
    <p>It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through <b>person-to-person contact.</b><br> Individuals can also be infected from and <b>touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face</b></p>
    <h4 id="sub">  A study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can last for several hours on various types of surfaces:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Copper (pennies, teakettles, cookware):</b> 4 hours</li>
  <li><b>Cardboard (shipping boxes):</b> up to 24 hours
     <li><b> Plastic (milk containers, detergent bottles, subway and bus seats, elevator buttons):</b> 2 to 3 days</li>
  <li><b>Stainless steel (refrigerators, pots and pans, sinks, some water bottles):</b> 2 to 3 days</li><br>
  That’s why it’s important to disinfect surfaces to get rid of the virus.</ul>

  <h2>Different waves in Covid 19</h2>
  <h3>1st wave</h3>
  <p>The first wave of the pandemic hit a lot of countries hard and many patients died. <b>Not enough specialized equipment and limited knowledge of the disease added to the severity of this first phase.</b><br><br>Some countries also have learned from the first wave that prevention is the only option.Only a hard <b>Lockdown</b> can bring down numbers sufficiently.Financial consequences  remained throughout 2021.</p>
  <h3>2nd wave</h3>
    <p>In many ways, the second ongoing surge in the Covid-19 cases of infection in India is different from the first one witnessed between April and September 2020. An obvious difference is that the second wave is far <b>more virulent in terms of the infection rate, though the trajectory for the death tally so far appears to have been mercifully dissimilar </b>to that seen during the first wave.<br><br>
      The second wave has been substantially <b>more rapid,</b> though the pace was relatively slow in the beginning. From about 9,000 cases with a death tally of less than 100 by the middle of February 2021, the number of reported cases rose to over 26,000 and the death tally went up to about 120 by the middle of March 2021.
    <br><br>
    The sharp rise in the pace of infections in the second surge has also exposed the serious weaknesses in the healthcare infrastructure in the country.<b> Shortages of oxygen, ICU beds and ventilators have surfaced alarmingly in almost all hospitals handling Covid cases.</b></p>

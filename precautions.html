    <h2>Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li type="square"><b>Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer.</b><br>This kills viruses on your hands.</li>
    <li type="square"><b>Practice social distancing.</b><br> Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.</li>
    
    <li type="square"><b>Cover your nose and mouth in public.</b> <br>If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don’t feel sick. Wear a cloth face covering to protect others. This isn’t a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you. Don’t use a face mask meant for health care workers. And don’t put a face covering on anyone who is:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Under 2 years old</li>
        <li>Having trouble breathing</li>
     <li> Unconscious or can’t remove the mask on their own for other reasons</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li type="square"><b>Don’t touch your face.</b><br> Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.</li>
    <li type="square"><b>Clean and disinfect.</b><br>You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks.<br> Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that’s approved to treat SARS-CoV-2. <br>You can check the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website to see if yours made the list. Wear gloves when you clean and throw them away when you’re done.</li></ul>

    <h2>Can Face Mask protect you from infection??</h2>
    <p>The CDC recommends that you wear a <b>cloth face mask </b>if you go out in public. 
      A mask is an <b>added layer of protection</b> for everyone, on top of social distancing efforts.<br><br> You can spread the virus when you talk or cough, even if you don’t know that you have it or if you aren’t showing signs of infection.
    The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible.</p>

    <h2>How can we protect ourselves and others when we don't know who is infected?</h2>
    <p>Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue.<br><br> Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!</p>

    <h2>How can you help stop the spread..</h2>
    <p>Because the virus spreads from person to person, it’s important to limit your contact with other people as much as possible. and avoid large gatherings. Many states and cities have eased restrictions but this doesn’t mean the virus is gone. Continue to <b>follow safety practices</b> such as wearing a cloth face mask in public places and washing your hands.<br><br>
      While many companies continue to use work-from-home practices, that is not possible for a lot of workers. <br>The following terms have now become commonplace:</p>
<ul>
   <li> <b>Social distancing or physical distancing,</b> keeping space between yourself and other people when you have to go out</li>
   <li> <b>Quarantine,</b> keeping someone home and separated from other people if they might have been exposed to the virus</li>
   <li> <b>Isolation,</b> keeping sick people away from healthy people, including using a separate “sick” bedroom and bathroom when possible</li><br><br>
      Precautions should still be followed even if you are vaccinated.

    </ul>
